# QNN FNL

## Overview

This repository implements Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) for financial applications, exploring how quantum computing can enhance machine learning models for financial prediction and analysis. The project leverages quantum circuits to create neural network architectures that may offer advantages in processing complex financial time series data.

## Features

- Hybrid quantum-classical neural network implementation
- Financial time series prediction using quantum circuits
- Customizable quantum layer architectures
- Benchmarking tools to compare quantum vs. classical approaches
- Visualization tools for quantum circuit states and financial predictions

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PennyLane 0.27+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- Qiskit 0.34+ (for IBM quantum backend support)
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib for data handling and visualization

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qnn_fnl.git
cd qnn_fnl

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
# Example code showing how to use your QNN implementation
from qnn.models import QuantumNeuralNetwork
from qnn.data import load_financial_dataset

# Load and preprocess financial data
train_data, test_data = load_financial_dataset('sp500', start_date='2010-01-01', end_date='2022-12-31')

# Create and train a QNN model
model = QuantumNeuralNetwork(
    n_qubits=4,
    n_layers=2,
    classical_units=[64, 32],
    optimizer='adam'
)

model.train(train_data, epochs=100, batch_size=32)
predictions = model.predict(test_data)

# Evaluate and visualize results
model.evaluate(test_data)
model.plot_predictions(test_data)
```

## Results

Our quantum neural network implementations show promising results on financial prediction tasks, with particular strength in capturing non-linear patterns in market volatility. The hybrid quantum-classical approach demonstrates up to 15% improvement in certain market conditions compared to classical deep learning baselines.
